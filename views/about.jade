  p My opinion is that most businesses that run PPC advertising focus too much on keywords and how much it costs to bid for them. 
  p They forget that PPC advertising, Search Engine Marketing and all its permutations are still advertising. Effective advertising IS salesmanship. As a business, you advertise to get more customers--not to build brands.
  p If you run a small business, you do cannot advertise the way big business does using brand advertising. They can afford that, you can't.
  p I started this blog to keep notes on my experience and test results from running adwords campaigns.
